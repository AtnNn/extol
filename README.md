# Plan

- a bootstrapped high-level declarative language (code name Extol)
  - [x] a Prolog parser in Prolog that can parse itself
  - [ ] a Prolog generator for the parsed AST
  - [ ] functions and expresisons similar to Ciao's fsyntax
  - [ ] anonymous predicates similar to Mercury
  - [ ] first-class predicates and functions, get rid of call

# Further ideas

- explicit lexical elements
- extensible lexical elements
- middle-out parsing
- parser for C
- types and constraints
- Unicode
- namespaces and modules
- rich library of data types
- non-binary const, open sets and maps
- parser for Python
- parser for JavaScript
- parser for Bash
- constraint and logic programming
- compiling interpreted scripts by tree shaking down to C
- convert between languages
- polyglot library for common types and functions
- polyglot FFI and messaging
- Convert C++ to C-ish: instantiate all templates, explicit construct, destroy, copy, move, convert and return
- theorem proving
- SMT
- make replacement
- parallelism
