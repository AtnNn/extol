# Roadmap

- a bootstrapped high-level declarative language (code name Extol)
  - ☑ a Prolog parser in Prolog that can parse itself
  - ☑ a Prolog generator for the parsed declaration
  - → type checking
  - □ proper AST instead of raw Prolog terms
  - □ custom prelude to wrap Prolog predicates
  - □ functions and expressions similar to Ciao's fsyntax
  - □ anonymous predicates similar to Mercury
  - □ first-class predicates and functions
  - □ modules and namespaces

(□ to do, → in progress, ☑ done)

# Further ideas

- explicit lexical elements
- extensible lexical elements
- middle-out parsing
- → parser for C
- types and constraints
- Unicode
- rich library of data types
- non-binary const, open sets and maps
- parser for Python
- parser for JavaScript
- parser for Bash
- constraint and logic programming
- compiling interpreted scripts by tree shaking down to C
- convert between languages
- polyglot library for common types and functions
- polyglot FFI and messaging
- Convert C++ to C-ish: instantiate all templates, explicit construct, destroy, copy, move, convert and return
- theorem proving
- SMT
- parallelism
